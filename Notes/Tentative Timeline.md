- **MM intro presentation - WIP - AUG 2nd/3rd**
	- Presentation about the current state of the art, and crash course intro to Micromouse!
	- Talk about Objectives n Constraints (Make teams for subsystem focus)
		- (By subteams, we will assign everyone a few constraints/objects to explore and brainstorm ideas for the next meeting)
- **Next refine the objectives** 
	- Go over everyone's interpretation of the constraints/objectives to figure out:
		- Exactly what sensors/components our mouse requires
		- Which mouse category (full size/ small size) we'd like
