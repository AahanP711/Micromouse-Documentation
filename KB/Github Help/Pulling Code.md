Pulling code means that you are updating the repository of code on your local computer by replacing it with the code from a remote repository (i.e. Github)

###### **Pulling your code**
==git pull name-of-remote-branch==

###### **Fetch + Merge**
pulling your code is actually a combination of 
==git fetch==
==git merge==

- Fetching your code basically obtains all your branches from the remote repo, but it doesn't automatically update/merge those changes from remote into your local repo

- Merging your code "merges" code changes from other branches or files into others

- Pulling is a combination of fetch & merge, and usually is entirely fine unless you have some merge conflicts.
