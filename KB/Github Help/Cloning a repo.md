kind of ironic that if you're here it means you know how to clone a repo already....

Github documentation for cloning a remote repo
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

make sure to open a terminal (MAC) or command prompt (WINDOWS) and run the commands inside the directory where you'd like to contain your git repository!

==git clone https://github.com/AahanP711/Micromouse-Documentation.git====

==git clone git@github.com:AahanP711/Micromouse-Documentation.git==

If you'd like to clone your repo with an ssh key go to [[SSH KEYS]] if you require more information
