kind of ironic that if you're here it means you know how to clone a repo already....

Github documentation for cloning a remote repo
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

If you'd like to clone your repo with an ssh key go to [[SSH KEYS]] if you require more information
