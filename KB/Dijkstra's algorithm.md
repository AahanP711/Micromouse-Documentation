The **Dijkstra's algorithm** is the **gold standard** for solving the single-source shortest path problem in graphs where **all edge weights are non-negative**. Unlike the brute-force iterative relaxation of Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra's is a **greedy algorithm**; it's always making the locally optimal choice in hopes of finding the global optimum.

Its core mechanism revolves around a **priority queue**. Starting from the source, it iteratively extracts the vertex with the **smallest known distance** that hasn't been "finalized" yet. Upon extracting a vertex, it then **relaxes** all its outgoing edges: for each neighbor, it checks if a shorter path to that neighbor can be found by going through the current vertex. If so, the neighbor's distance is updated in the priority queue. This process effectively expands outwards from the source, like **ripples in a pond**, always confirming the shortest path to a vertex before exploring its neighbors.

The **critical caveat** is its **absolute intolerance for negative edge weights**, as its greedy nature can get trapped in incorrect paths. However, for graphs with only non-negative weights, Dijkstra's is significantly more efficient, typically achieving a time complexity of O(ElogV) or O(E+VlogV) when implemented with a [[min-priority queue]] (e.g., a [[Fibonacci heap]] or [[binary heap]]), making it a cornerstone for applications like network routing protocols and geographic information systems.
